# PDF Extractor
This is a simple python script for extracting pages from .pdf files.

I wrote this to be able to save articles from books and collections in separate files.

To uese it you need to provide the following information in relevant places:
 
+ the name of the target file,

+ the numbers of the first and last page to be extracted (as integers!)

+ the name of the output file (don't forget the .pdf extension)
